How to aggregate the categorical features, take the mode or create a new binary/dummy variables whether or not that particular category was represented for the user. The same refers to the numeric ones, that is to use the average of time or again create separate columns for each app category and fill them with time spent.\n",

My first idea was to use general knowledge for selecting the most important ones, however with my aggregation there can be many columns, that's why I will use an anova-test for calculating f-statistics between categorical and numeric features and spearman correlation for numeric features. Depending on the results the other thing I can do is to treat the target as a categorical column and calculate anova test for the remaining numeric features."
